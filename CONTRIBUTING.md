# Contributing to BrowserForge MCP

Thank you for helping. BrowserForge is built to be extended by everyone: you do not need to touch the core to add something useful.

## Ways to contribute

| You want to... | Do this |
|---|---|
| Share a way of working (a recipe for an agent) | Write a **skill**: a folder with a `SKILL.md`. No code. See [docs/SKILLS.md](docs/SKILLS.md). |
| Add tools (a new integration, a file format, your own logic) | Write a **plugin**. See [docs/PLUGINS.md](docs/PLUGINS.md). Publish it on npm with the `browserforge-plugin` keyword, or open a pull request to list it. |
| Add an export format for recorded flows | An **exporter**: [docs/FLOWS.md](docs/FLOWS.md). |
| Fix a bug or improve the core | A pull request, as below. |
| Report a bug or an idea | An issue (templates are provided). For security problems, read [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) first and report privately. |

## Set up

You need Node 22 or newer, and Firefox and/or Chrome for the end-to-end tests.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zoghlamimostafa/BrowserForge-MCP.git && cd BrowserForge-MCP
npm ci
npm run build
npm run typecheck && npm run lint
npm test                 # unit + security + integration (no browser needed)
npm run test:e2e         # real Firefox and Chromium (and local models if Ollama is running)
```

Layout: `packages/*` are libraries, `apps/mcp-server` is the MCP server, `apps/firefox-extension` is the browser extension (built for Firefox and Chrome), `plugins/*` are reference plugins, `skills/*` reference skills, `examples/*` minimal examples. [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) explains how they fit together.

## Pull requests

* **Small and focused.** One change per pull request, with a description of the problem it solves.
* **Tests.** New behaviour comes with tests; a bug fix comes with a test that fails without the fix. Anything that touches approvals, file access or permissions needs a test for the case that must be refused.
* **Checks pass:** `npm run build && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test`. CI runs the same.
* **Docs.** If a user would notice the change, update the README or the relevant page in `docs/`, and `docs/LIMITATIONS.md` if something is not covered.
* **No personal data.** Never commit real names, emails, CVs, tokens or captured traffic. Use obviously fake data in tests and examples.
* Match the code around yours: naming, comment density, the existing helpers (look before you add a new one).
* **An agent reviews every pull request.** Claude reads the whole diff, and the PR is merged automatically when the review is clean, the tests pass on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows, and the change is small and does not touch the files listed in [docs/PR_AGENT.md](docs/PR_AGENT.md) (dependencies, installer and release files, and the CI/agent files themselves wait for a maintainer). The review comment says exactly what it found or why it is waiting. Your first pull request's CI waits for the agent's approval; this is expected.

## Ground rules for changes

These are what users rely on, so changes that weaken them will not be merged:

1. **The human approves consequential actions**, and that gate lives in the extension, out of reach of agents, pages and plugins.
2. **Page content is untrusted data.** Anything that comes from a web page is marked as such for the agent.
3. **Secrets are redacted** by default and never written to logs, flows or traces.
4. **Everything stays on this machine** unless the user explicitly sends it elsewhere. Local models must be on loopback.
5. **Least privilege for extensions.** Plugins declare what they need; skills cannot run code.

## Writing a plugin or skill for others

Keep permissions minimal and explain each one in your README. Say what your plugin sends where. Name your tools with your prefix. Test with `createTestApi`. Publish with the `browserforge-plugin` keyword so `browserforge plugin search` finds it. Maintainers may link good plugins from the README; listing is not an endorsement or a security review.
